# izitest

A mini project for my application to IZI Mobile.

## Instructions

1. Set up a GitHub repository for the project, call it izitest.
2. Initialize a React application (use redux if you’re feeling spry but it’s not required).
3. Use our endpoint which will return 10 memorials, and display the name and creation date of each memorial, sorted in order of creationDate.
  - Endpoint: https://dev.requiemapp.com/public/memorial/random
4. Create a button on the page that when pressed will switch the sorting on the list to last name of the decedent (name.last)
